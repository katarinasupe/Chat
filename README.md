# Chat
Web chat application made with software design pattern MVC (model-view-controller)

* I have created a database with different users, messages and channels. User has to log into the application and then the user can see their channels and messages within each channel. Each message has a time when it was sent and the number of thumbs up. The user can give thumbs up to a message or write its own message. User can also create a new channel.
